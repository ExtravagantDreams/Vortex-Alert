        <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 25%; font-size: 50px;"> How do hurricanes form? </p> 
        <li style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;">Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters when rising moist air creates a low-pressure system, and the Coriolis effect induces a spinning motion. Low wind shear and specific atmospheric conditions contribute to their development, progressing from a tropical disturbance to a mature hurricane with distinct categories based on wind speed.</li>
        <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 25%; font-size: 50px;"> What kind of destruction hurricanes cause? </p> 
        <li style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 60%;">Hurricanes cause destruction through powerful winds that damage structures and vegetation, leading to extensive property and infrastructure damage. Storm surges from hurricanes result in coastal flooding and erosion, posing a significant threat to coastal communities. Heavy rainfall leads to freshwater flooding, affecting both urban and rural areas and contributing to property damage and safety risks.</li> 
        <p style="margin-left: 3%; margin-right: 40%; font-size: 50px;"> How are different hurricane categories defined? </p> 
        <li style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 60%;"> Hurricane categories are defined by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which classifies hurricanes based on their sustained wind speeds. The scale consists of five categories, with Category 1 having the lowest wind speeds (74-95 mph) and Category 5 having the highest (157 mph or higher), providing a standardized way to communicate the potential impact and destructiveness of a hurricane.</li>
